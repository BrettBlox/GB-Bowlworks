This beauty is a 10.5" by 5.5" segmented Cherry & Maple salad bowl with matching tongs.  This vessel was sanded to 1000 grit and then mineral oil was applied to darken and protect it.  With a little TLC, this salad bowl will last for years to come and be a mainstay on your dinner table!  All salad bowl purchases come with a bottle of food-safe oil to keep your bowl and tongs looking good for years.
