This is my most recent piece and is comprised of 1872 segments of Wenge, Yellowheart, Padauk, Maple and Cherry.  This beauty stands in at 11.5" in height and 10.5" diameter.  This was an 11-day project.  The color combination along with the interesting pattern really jumps out at you.  This would be a dynamic table centerpiece or complete your display or mantel area.
