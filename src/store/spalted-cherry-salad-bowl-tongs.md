A segmented salad bowl with matching tongs utilizing some amazing spalted Cherry capped off with a Wenge rim that helps highlight the dark spalting in the Cherry.  The bowl and tongs are finished with a food-safe mineral oil that really brings out the beauty of the wood.  The bowl is 12" in diameter and 6" in height...plenty big enough for a salad for the whole family.  The matching unique tongs fit your hands just right and add some personality to the bowl.
