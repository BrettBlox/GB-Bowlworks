  Occasionally you get a really nice piece of figured (quilted) hardwood.  That
  was the case with this particular vase I just finished.  I had been saving the
  piece of quilted Walnut for just the right occasion. 


  This vase consists of 304 segments made from Walnut, Wenge, Maple and Padauk. 
  It is 10" in height and 9" in diameter.
