I love woodworking. I love the satisfaction I get from making things out of wood. I love the feel and smell of wood. I even love peeling dried glue off
my fingers after I make something.

I’m a woodworker, have been since as far back as I can remember. I come by it naturally...got it from my dad. Dad was a shade-tree mechanic, woodworker, electrician, plumber, etc., and I was
his shadow. I took my dad’s interest in woodworking and refined it a little. I’ve zeroed in on bowl turning. Something
about it just makes my day! To be able to take a piece of sometimes gnarly, cracked, warped wood and bring out the inner
beauty by recycling it into something useful does something for me. Making something that will more than likely be
around long after I am is just the neatest thing ever. 

​In 1972 my dad bought a Shopsmith woodworking machine...you know, one of those do-it-all machines. It was a table saw, a lathe, a boring machine, a drill press, a
disk sander, etc. I was 11 and really wanted to try the lathe out, so I mounted a 2x4 on it, spun it up, barely touched
a gouge to the spinning wood...and promptly threw it off the lathe halfway across the garage! No one ever knew I did
that, until now. I quickly realized I needed a little help figuring that machine out.

In 1976, as a high school freshman, I enrolled in what ended up being the best class in the world for me...shop class, thanks to my shop
teacher, J. D. Newland,. I made several pieces of furniture over the four years I was there, most of which are scattered
around my mother’s home.

Over the years I started accumulating woodworking equipment and made a lot of things. My first real lathe was a Jet 12-36. I took a class at a local woodworking store and made my first bowl. I still
have it. It sits on my dresser and I put each day’s pocket change in it. I then stumbled onto segmented turning and made
a few little bowls...and a spark was lit. I was right in the middle of raising kiddos at the time and told myself that
one of these days I would focus more on getting better at segmented turning.

​Fast-forward a few years. My wife and I became empty-nesters and suddenly had a little more time on our hands. I discovered I had time to get more
invested in segmented turning and began focusing most of my time on it. The little Jet 12-36 had served its purpose but
it was time to upgrade to a more capable machine, one that would allow for larger vessels. After upgrading to a more
substantial lathe, I’m now able to turn bowls up to 18” in diameter, which seems to be (at least for now) just right.


I still consider myself a student of the art; there’s so much room for improvement in what I do, but even if I don’t get better, I’m having a great time doing what I’m doing. Thanks for reading my ramblings, and stay tuned for
more GB Bowlworks masterpieces in the near future!
