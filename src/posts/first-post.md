title: Drum Sander
body: 'I have found that one of the biggest challenges in segmented turning is the ability to sand the individual rings before gluing them together. At first, I used a large sanding disk for the lathe and I would simply hold the ring up to the disk to get it ready to glue to the next ring. This worked...sort of...but created a massive amount of dust in the shop, no matter how I positioned a dust collection hose. Time to come up with a better way. I began looking into drum sanders by Jet and a few others. I stumbled onto a video about a machine called FlatMaster and found what I thought would be the best design. On YouTube I found a three-video series entitled "V-Drum Sander Build" about a homemade benchtop drum sander that gave me some ideas, so I hatched my plan.

I started with a 5/8 steel shaft 36" long, then cut a series of MDF disks and glued them together on the shaft.'
