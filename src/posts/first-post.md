title: That Old Pecan Stump
---

In 1968 my mom received this pecan stump/stool from her brother as a Christmas gift.

For 45 years it sat in my parents den. In 2013 she asked if I wanted it, which I did. I knew it was pecan but had no idea how beautiful the wood grain was. I cut into it and found some amazing spalting but lots of cracks, splits and pith.

I was able to find enough decent wood to make two bowls. Each bowl had some cracks that I cleaned up and then filled with some turquoise inlay.

I completed the turning and applied a few coats of friction polish.

I gave the bowls to my mom and uncle. Sometimes you never know whatâ€™s under that bark!
