title: Shop Remodel
---
I've had two shops in my woodworking life, one that was too big, 700 square feet, (I can't believe anyone could have a shop TOO big!)...

... and one that was too small, 100 square feet.

 My small shop, being my most recent, was super cozy...but cramped.  For six years my woodworking world existed in that 100 square feet.  Amazingly, I got a lot accomplished there.  I learned how to be more organized...everything had to have its place.



In late 2017, I had my son home for a few weeks over the holidays and decided to put him to work and remodel and expand to a whopping 200 square feet, doubling my shop space.  We did some framing and dry wall work, some electrical, some painting, and ended up with a really nice shop.

I then upgraded my lathe, a huge decision, but one that needed to be made in order to up my game on the bowls I was making.  No regrets!  I went from a Jet 12-36 to a Laguna 18-36, meaning I can now make a bowl up to 18 inches in diameter.

I'm definitely looking forward to making a few more interesting bowls with this new machine.
