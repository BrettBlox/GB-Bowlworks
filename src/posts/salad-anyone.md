title: Salad Anyone!
---
As a bowl maker, you look for inspiration for the next bowl.  I have a friend that has a salad bowl she and her husband received back 40 years ago for a wedding gift.  They still use it all the time.  She uses it only for Caesar salads.  Before using it, she rubs fresh garlic on the inside of the bowl to enhance the aroma of the salad.  After using it, of course, she carefully cleans it and dries it, and puts it back in its place until the next time.  The garlic rub intrigued and inspired me.  Here are pics of my most recent salad bowls.  The first sold immediately, and I've still got the second one...and I'm not sure I want to get rid of it...but more are in the works.

I'm anxious to try the garlic rub!  I'll let you know how it works, but I'm hungry just thinking about it.
