As a bowl maker, you look for inspiration for the next bowl.  I have a friend that has a salad bowl she and her husband received as a wedding gift 40 years ago.  They still use it all the time.  She uses it only for Caesar salads.  Before using it, she rubs fresh garlic on the inside of the bowl to enhance the aroma of the salad.  After using it, of course, she carefully cleans it and dries it, and puts it back in its place until the next time.  The garlic rub intrigued and inspired me.  Here are pics of a few of the recent salad bowls I've made, and others are always in the works.

I'm anxious to try the garlic rub!  I'll let you know how it works, but I'm hungry just thinking about it.
