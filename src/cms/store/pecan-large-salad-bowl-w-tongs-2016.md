This large salad bowl with tongs is constructed from Pecan.  I was able to buy a nice amount of this wood from a friend/coworker who took the tree down in her yard.  The bowl is 11.5" in diameter, and is 5.5" in height.  The bottom of the bowl has a nice touch of sapwood and heartwood, making for a dynamic contrast.  It was constructed using 144 segments.  Of course, coming with the bowl and tongs is a complementary tin of my wood butter/conditioner to keep its luster for years to come.
