A funky little lidded canister made with Hickory and Walnut.  The lid has a Walnut finial, and the Hickory in it shows off some nice sap wood contrast.  This piece consists of 240 segments, is 5.5" tall and 6" in diameter.  This would make a fantastic candy dish, coffee canister, or even memorial urn.
