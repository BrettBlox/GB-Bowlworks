A new product I'm making, a segmented wireless Bluetooth speaker. The enclosure's pattern is the Aztec Star using
Walnut, Padauk and Maple. It has 96 segments. It stands 3.5" in height and is 5" in diameter. After turning the
enclosure, I add the Rockler speaker components. A beefy little speaker that has amazing sound. You will get the
speaker, an owner's manual with technical specifications outlining the directions for use and charging. Personally, I
have one of these on my desk at work and one at home that sits on the bathroom counter. It connects to your phone or
computer via Bluetooth. Charge time is about one hour, with playback times ranging three to four hours.
