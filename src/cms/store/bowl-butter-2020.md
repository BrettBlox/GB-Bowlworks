A 2-ounce tin of my food-safe salad bowl and cutting board butter/conditioner.  Made from organic beeswax and mineral oil with a hint of lemon.  A perfect addition to maintain your salad bowls and tongs, and cutting boards.  Apply just like you would when you wax your car; let stand for a few minutes, and then buff off to reveal a polished and protective coat that will help maintain your favorite salad bowls and cutting boards.
