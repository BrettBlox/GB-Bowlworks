The third of three in the Peaks series.  This vase measures in a little smaller at 6" in height and 6.5" in diameter.  The woods I used in this really compliment each other: Sapele and Red Oak.  The sheen attained using Sapele is phenomenal.  There are 468 segments in this piece, 13 rows of 36 segments per.  A fun piece that would make a beautiful display on your mantel!
