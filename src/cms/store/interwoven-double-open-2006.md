This is the third piece in the interwoven series I've done.  This vase consists of 480 segments, using Walnut, Wenge, Maple and Bloodwood.  It stands 8" in height and has a max diameter of 11".  It was finished using my old favorite, Mylands Friction Polish, producing a luster and sheen that really makes the color variation pop.  This piece really stands out on your bookshelf or mantel!
