A good friend/coworker and her husband harvested a huge Pecan tree from their front yard and ended up with close to 900 board feet of some amazing wood.  I was fortunate enough to buy a good supply of it.  It's in my secret stash of prized hardwood in my shop.  This large salad bowl comes in at 11.5" in diameter and is 5.5" in height, and has a mixture of both sapwood and heartwood for a colorful contrast.  Fill this bowl full of your favorite salad and you can definitely have a feast!  Included with the bowel are a set of tongs that I make for every bowl and a bottle of mineral oil to help lubricate and shine your new salad bowl for years.
