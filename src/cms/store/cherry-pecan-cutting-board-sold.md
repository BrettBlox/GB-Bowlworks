A large (12" x 18") cutting board made with Oklahoma Pecan and Cherry, showing off a unique grain consisting of both heart wood and sap wood.  My cutting boards are sanded to 320 and then protected with my own blend of beeswax and mineral oil.  All joints are glued with waterproof glue using biscuit joinery.  And, of course, all of my cutting boards are guaranteed for life.  With your purchase of this board will be provided a complimentary tin of GB Bowlworks Wood Butter.
