A new item from my shop, a palm rest for your small computer keyboard.  This item measures in at 3.25" wide, 14.75" long, and a tallest height (against your keyboard) is .60.  I use both domestic and exotic hardwood in the construction.  This particular piece is composed of Wenge, Hickory, Purpleheart, Bubinga, Lacewood and Cherry.  A palm rest lessens fatigue on your wrist while working at your computer, and adds a touch of class to your desk.
