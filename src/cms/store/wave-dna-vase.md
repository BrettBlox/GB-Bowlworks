I just finished this little beauty.  It's an open-segment vase consisting of several hardwood species: Yellowheart, Purpleheart, Maple, Wenge and Padauk.  It has a total of 456 segments, has 19 segmented rows with 24 segments in each row, and the row height is .25.  It stands in at 6" in height and is 5" in diameter.  It is friction polished to a low sheen (I DON'T DO SHINY IN MY SHOP!), and the color you see is the natural color of the wood.
