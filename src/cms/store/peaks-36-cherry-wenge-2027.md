Another vase in my Peaks series.  This piece measures in at 10" in height and 8" in diameter.  I used Cherry with Wenge accents.  Hard to see in the photos is the fact that I used darker (heartwood) Cherry for the base, rim, and segments below the Wenge.  The amazing thing with Cherry is the fact that it darkens over time, highlighting its rich luster...so, this piece's heartwood portions will only get darker.  There are 540 segments in this vase - 15 rows with 36 segments per.
