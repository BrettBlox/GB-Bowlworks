This large vase is fresh off the lathe.  It is comprised of 384 segments of a favorite combination in my shop: Walnut, Wenge, Padauk and Maple.  The concho pattern is evident in this piece, hence the name, and it has 32 segments per row.  It stands in at 10" in height and has a maximum diameter of 12".  This color scheme really pops with color and design and would be a fantastic table centerpiece or mantel statement.
