A variation of a vase I designed a couple of years ago, this piece is constructed with Brazilian Goncalo Alves (a/k/a Tigerwood) and domestic Maple.  Pictures don't do the Goncalo justice, as it is a beautiful, dense hardwood with a rich texture.  The dimensions of this vase are 11" in height and 7" in diameter.  It consists of 468 segments, with 36 segments per ring.  This is definitely an eye-catcher and would fit well on your mantel or display case.
