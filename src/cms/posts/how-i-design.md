title: How I Design
---
The most common question I'm asked as a segmenter is, "Do you use software to design your bowls?"  The answer is a resounding, "YES!"  Is it cheating?  "YES!"  Is it fun?  "ABSOLUTELY!"  Designing bowls and vessels using software is almost as much fun as actually turning them!  Really!

Early on, back about 20 years ago, when I got interested in turning, after buying my first lathe, I would cut blanks using my chainsaw and mount them on the lathe and turn them.  While that was a fun start, it became pretty boring after a while because it was a lot of work...finding timber/logs, cutting them, debarking them, finally turning them and watching them warp because they weren't dried.  For me, there had to be a better way.  Enter segmenting.

I got interested in segmenting for two reasons:  1) The ability to use kiln-dried wood that I could go to a hardwood store and buy; and 2)  The ability to mix and match different species of hardwood.

I started out designing my bowls using grid paper and a simple formula:  Diameter times Pi divided by the number of segments in a row.  I had constructed a crude sled for my tablesaw that allowed for 12 segments per row.  It barely worked due to the fact it wasn't accurate and allowed for gaps in the finished ring.  I would have two half rings that didn't butt up to each other without a gap, so I'd have to sand the edges to make them work.  It worked but I didn't like it and knew there had to be a better way.

Enter WoodTurnerPro.com.  A wood turner, Lloyd Johnson, from Washington state, built a website and sold software called WoodTurnerPro.  I was hooked. I also discovered a few videos on YouTube by Jerry Bennett.  Jerry came up with a new sled for segmenting called a Wedgie Sled.  Game-changer!

The combination of WoodTurnerPro software and the Wedgie Sled completely changed the way I approached designing and building segmented bowls.  They are just tools I use, along with my saws and lathes, to create.  No secrets...anyone can do what I do...and there are many of you out there that do a better job than I do!

Since WoodTurnerPro, Lloyd Johnson has built SegmentPro.  I use them both.  Each has its own unique features.  While WTP is going on 20 years old, it is a powerful software and allows me to create designs very easily.  SP is a new-and-improved 3D software that is very user friendly...and just plain fun!  

I would encourage anyone to check out WoodTurnerPro and SegmentPro.  They are game-changers for segmenters.  They are relatively inexpensive and very user-friendly.  WoodTurnerPro.com offers a forum for users to comment and share ideas and tips.  Check it out!
