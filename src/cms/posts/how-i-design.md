title: How I Design
---
The most common question I'm asked as a segmenter is, "Do you use software to design your bowls?"  The answer is a resounding, "YES!"  There is a learning curve, but once you spend some time learning the ins and outs of the program, the sky is the limit!

Early on, back about 20 years ago, when I got interested in turning, after buying my first lathe, I would cut blanks using my chainsaw and mount them on the lathe and turn them.  While that was a fun start, it became pretty boring after a while because it was a lot of work...finding timber/logs, cutting them, debarking them, finally turning them and watching them warp because they weren't dried.  For me, there had to be a better way.  Enter segmenting.

I got interested in segmenting for two reasons:  1) The ability to use kiln-dried wood that I could go to a hardwood store and buy; and 2)  The ability to mix and match different species of hardwood and create repeatable patterns.

I started out designing my bowls using grid paper and a simple formula:  Diameter times Pi divided by the number of segments in a row.  I had constructed a crude sled for my table saw that allowed for 12 segments per row.  It barely worked due to the fact it wasn't accurate and allowed for gaps in the finished ring.  I would have two half rings that didn't butt up to each other without a gap, so I'd have to sand the edges to make them work.  It worked but I didn't like it and knew there had to be a better way.

Two items forever changed the landscape in segmented turning for me: WoodTurnerPro/SegmentPro software and the Wedgie Sled.  Game-changer!

The combination of WoodTurnerPro/SegmentPro software and the Wedgie Sled completely changed the way I approached designing and building segmented bowls.  They are just tools I use, along with my saws and lathes, to create.  No secrets...anyone can do what I do...and there are many of you out there that do a better job than I do!  The Wedgie Sled (something you can build in your shop) gives you the ability to create prefect segmented rings with no gaps EVERY TIME!

I would encourage anyone to look into using software as a design tool in bowl building, no matter what program you end up using.  It was a game-changer for me and really reinvigorated me as a turner. 

If I can assist you in any way, or if you have questions, please contact me.
