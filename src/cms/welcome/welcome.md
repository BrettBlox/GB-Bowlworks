title: Welcome to GB Bowlworks

GB Bowlworks, LLC, is a woodturning business based in Oklahoma, owned and operated by me, [Greg Bloxom](/about). I make segmented bowls and vessels.  The photo gallery below has a few of the past and present pieces out of my shop.  Most sales are done at the various art shows I attend, so be sure to check out the upcoming events section of this website.  Use the [Contact](https://www.gbbowlworks.com/contact) page if you'd like to commission a specific piece...or just have a question.  I'm also on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gbbowlworks/) where I post photos and videos of current work.

"Thanks for stopping by!"
